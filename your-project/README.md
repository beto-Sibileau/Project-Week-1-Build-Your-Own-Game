## Project Description
This project is about building an experience of playing a classic game against the computer: Tic Tac Toe.
This game brings a nice memory about playing it at primary school - a really analogic experience with paper and pen! -.

<!---
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why. it has a kind of geometric thinking
-->

## Rules
The game starts asking about which player would begin. The playground is nothing but the 9 spaces delimited by a big slash - # - symbol. Each turn, the player will select one space to be marked by a round symbol - O - while the computer will mark its choice with a cross - X -. Each space can be marked only once, allowing maximum 9 turns to be played. Tic Tac Toe finishes either tied after 9 turns or with a winner, whenever a player marks *a line* of three consecutive symbols.

<!---
Briefly describe the rules of the game.
