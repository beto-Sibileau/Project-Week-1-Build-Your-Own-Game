## Project Description
This project is about building an experience of playing a classic game against the computer: Tic Tac Toe.
This game brings a nice memory about playing it at primary school - a really analogic experience with paper and pen! -.

<!---
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why. it has a kind of geometric thinking
-->

## Rules
The game starts asking about which player would begin. The playground is nothing but the 9 spaces delimited by a big slash - # - symbol. Each turn, the player will select one space to be marked by a round symbol - O - while the computer will mark its choice with a cross - X -. Each space can be marked only once, allowing maximum 9 turns to be played. Tic Tac Toe finishes either tied after 9 turns or with a winner, whenever a player marks *a line of three* consecutive symbols.

Briefly describe the rules of the game.

## Workflow
I began by writing the project description and game rules in this page. Being Tic Tac Toe a classic, there was no need of research to get familiar with the game. Then, I considered the following steps to tackle the problem:

* Pseudo-code writing.
* Functions coding.
* Game loop coding using previously tested functions.
* Test game and error assestment.


<!---
Given the popularity of the game, it did not need any time of research at all

## Organization
I found very useful to begin by checking the proposed tasks at a Trello board designed by our TA. It helped me a lot for assigning an estimated deadline for the main duties to accomplish the project. Among these, what I struggled the most was the lack of time to test different game loops that assign diverse game levels or *cpu intelligence* (using the very same functions).

## Concluding remarks

- A geometric approach that measures the direction between Tic Tac Toe marks allows an elegant way to predict wining moves.
- An organized plan is a key element to develop a programming project. However, expect that unplanned issues will appear while the coding is being executed.
